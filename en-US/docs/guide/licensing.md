# Licensing

grekt uses a multi-license strategy to balance openness with sustainability.

## License Overview

| Component | License | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **CLI** | Apache 2.0 | Open, auditable, extensible |
| **Engine** | BSL 1.1 | Source-available, protected core |
| **Keywords** | MIT | Fully open utility |

## Why This Structure?

### CLI (Apache 2.0)

The CLI is the user-facing tool. Apache 2.0 ensures:

- Full transparency for security audits
- Freedom to fork and extend
- Patent protection for contributors
- Enterprise-friendly terms

### Engine (BSL 1.1)

The engine contains core business logic. BSL 1.1 provides:

- **Source available**: You can read, audit, and learn from the code
- **Non-production use**: Free for development, testing, and evaluation
- **Time-limited protection**: Converts to Apache 2.0 after 4 years
- **Commercial licensing**: Available for production use before conversion

This protects the project's sustainability while keeping the code transparent.

### Keywords (MIT)

The keyword extraction utility is fully open source under MIT. Use it however you want.
