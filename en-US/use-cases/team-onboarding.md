description: "Use grekt to onboard new developers with consistent AI tool configurations. One command gives everyone identical agents, skills, and rules."

# Team onboarding

Get every developer on your team running with identical AI context in one command. No more "works on my machine" for AI tool configs.

## The problem

A new developer joins your team. They need to set up their AI tools, but:

- The team's custom agents, skills, and rules live in a shared doc that's already outdated
- Every developer has slightly different versions of the same configs
- Someone updated the code review agent last week but forgot to tell anyone
- The new hire spends half a day copying files around and still ends up with a broken setup

AI context drift is the same problem dependency drift solved years ago. Without a lockfile, everyone runs something slightly different.

## The solution

### 1. Initialize grekt in your project

The team lead sets up grekt **once**:

```bash
grekt init
```

This creates `grekt.yaml` and `grekt.lock` in your project root, plus a `.grekt/` directory for downloaded artifacts and local config. The `.grekt/` directory is **automatically gitignored** - only `grekt.yaml` and `grekt.lock` are committed to your repo.

### 2. Add your team's artifacts

Install the artifacts your team uses:

```bash
grekt add @your-org/code-review-agent --core
grekt add @your-org/testing-skills --core
grekt add @your-org/project-rules --core
```

Each artifact is recorded in `grekt.yaml` and resolved versions with checksums are locked in `grekt.lock`.

### 3. New developer joins

The new hire clones the repo and runs:

```bash
grekt install
```

That's it. They get the **exact same versions** of every artifact (verified by SHA256 checksums), synced to their AI tools.

### 4. Keep everyone aligned

When someone updates an artifact:

```bash
grekt upgrade @your-org/code-review-agent
```

Other developers pull and run `grekt install` to stay in sync. Or verify their setup:

```bash
grekt check
```

## Result

After setup, your project looks like this:

```
your-project/
├── grekt.yaml          # Committed - what artifacts you depend on
├── grekt.lock          # Committed - exact resolved versions + checksums
├── .grekt/             # Gitignored - local artifacts, index, config
├── .claude/            # Synced configs (Claude Code target)
└── src/
```

Only `grekt.yaml` and `grekt.lock` go into version control. The `.grekt/` directory (downloaded artifacts, index, tokens) is local to each machine and regenerated by `grekt install`.

Every developer runs `grekt install` and gets:
- The same artifact versions (locked)
- The same sync targets (configured)
- The same AI behavior (reproducible)
